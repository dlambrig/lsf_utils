NAME
    whos_hammering - show users with the most jobs using a given filesystem server

SYNOPSIS
    whos_hammering SERVERNAME...

DESCRIPTION
    For each given SERVERNAME, this prints the users running the most jobs 
    where the current working directory, command line, and/or -o file includes 
    a path on a filesystem exported by the given server.  This may give a hint 
    as to who's hammering a filesystem.  A big number is only a problem if the 
    jobs are actually doing i/o; plus the job may be using the filesystem 
    unbeknownst to LSF.  If a NFS server has nfswatch installed, that's a much 
    better sleuthing tool (hit a to see authenticator counts).

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Print this help.

REQUIREMENTS
    bjobs2
